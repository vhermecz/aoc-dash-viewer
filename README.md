# aoc-dash-viewer

An SPA to let you watch completion times for private dashboards.

:warning: **Under development**, currently holds only mock values as requires the AOC server to allow CORS for their JSON API to let us read it from the browser.

## Development

If you want to tweak, install docker-compose and fire it up via `docker-compose up`.

Should be available at http://localhost:7900/
